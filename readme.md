## Current Experiments

Would you rather shorts (pretty low qualitiy for now)

## Edge - Why this will work
Short form video is saturated - along with automation, *but* there are still niches and unique/new formats that can be created and capitalized on.

## Formats

List of ideas for short video formats
- reddit posts
- podcast clips (context aware - ML or other)
- movie / show clips
- side picking / fact game
- cherry-picking most interesting parts of videos (based on replay data from youtube)
    - hasn't been done?? - edge

This will be our bread and butter so will need more of these ideas

## Engine Architecture

Need to create a easy library that can load videos and audio and save in short type format which is 9:16 format (the long way)
